- I needed to run `wp acorn vendor:publish` to generate the `config` directory and its files. 
  - With those files generated, I included the `Log1x\Poet\PoetServiceProvider::class` in the service providers section as per [this solutions](https://github.com/Log1x/navi) advice due to this publish option not being available with the `acorn` command listed in the `Poet` repo.
