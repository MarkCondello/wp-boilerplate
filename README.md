## Project install
From the root directory run `composer install`
From the `web/app/themes/sgy-boilerplate` directory run:
- `composer install`
- Run `yarn` from the theme directory to install dependencies
- Update `bud.config.js` with your local dev URL and file changes to `watch()`
- `yarn build` â€” Compile assets

## Custom directory structure
Using the [`composer/installers` package]('https://github.com/composer/installers'), we have defined where Wordpress and plugins are installed with settings added to the `installer-paths` and `wordpress-install-dir` in the root composer .json. This is how the standard [`Bedrock` setup](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/environment-variables/) is structured.

*Bebrock control flow:* The application loads through to `/web` via the root .htaccess redirect settings. The application then delegates to the `wp-config.php` file there and flows through to the `/config/application.php` file. `Bedrock` setup allows us to define environment specific settings for any project.

## .env settings
The default configuration (if a `WP_ENV` setting is not added in the `.env`) is `production`. Currently the 2 supported environment settings are:
 - development
 - staging
Environment-specific overrides for *development* or *staging* go in their respective `config/environments/{{WP_ENV}}.php` files.
**Note:** Other environment specific settings can be applied by creating a new file in the `/config/environments` directory and referencing that file in the root `.env` file.

*/config/application.php*
```
$env_config = __DIR__ . '/environments/' . WP_ENV . '.php';
if (file_exists($env_config)) {
    require_once $env_config;
}
```
A good default policy is to deviate from the production config as little as possible. Try to define as much of your configuration settings in the `/config/application.php` file as possible.

## sgy-boilerplate sage theme
We can remove tailwind settings (which come with the sage install by default) by using the following [instructions](https://roots.io/sage/docs/replacing-tailwind-with-bootstrap/).

These instructions help with [setting up Zurb Foundation](https://discourse.roots.io/t/using-foundation-6-7-5-with-sage-10/24637) withing the sage theme.

Ensure any `bud-PACKAGE` NPM packages use the same version as the `@roots/bud` installed to avoid build errors.

`yarn` must be used for installing packages with the sage roots theme. Details of the available `yarn` commands are [here](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/npm/audit).
